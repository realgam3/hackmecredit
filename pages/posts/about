    <h1>About <em>The Project</em></h1>
    <p>
		I made this project for my practical engineering studies,<br />
		This project is very good for training web penetration testing (OWASP TOP 10 Vulnerabilities).<br />
		The best ways to work with HackMe Credit is to install Firefox(with plugins) or HconSTF and Burpsuite.<br />
		Its recommended to install HackMe Credit on Virtual Machine (VMware / Virtual Box) and not on personal computer because its not secured.
