# HackMe Credit (Vulnerable Web Application)

I made this project for my practical engineering studies, <br>
This project is very good for training web penetration testing (OWASP TOP 10 Vulnerabilities).

**The best way to install my vulnerable application is:** <br>
**\* check the download area if you don't want to work hard**
 1. Install it on virtual machine using VMWARE or Virtual box. (I will
    upload my pack).
 2. Install java + tomcat + MySQL java connector.
 3. Install the database - for that you need to change the password in
    the Mysql.java(in WEB-INF/classes/com/hackme) file and then compile
    the files.
 4. Put all the files in the ROOT folder in the tomcat folder
    (/var/lib/tomcatVER).
 5. Download your favorite penetration testing tools.
 6. Compile the \*.java(in WEB-INF/classes/com/hackme) files with: javac
    -cp \*.java .I made this project for my practical engineering studies, 
    
**\* You can also install this web application on Backtrack and all the
    others. <br>For Backtrack you need to change the password in Mysql.java
    (in WEB-INF/classes/com/hackme) to toor.**
